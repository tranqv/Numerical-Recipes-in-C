Many things have been changed, e.g., all the names of subroutines, so that this version of the code is more portable than the original one.

# How to use? 

In Linux terminal, perform the command:

    bash sh.make.dev

Then, read the guide on your screen. 

For example, to run everything, you can run this command:

    bash sh.make.dev  all 

Enjoy coding!
